    "In this analysis, we aimed to identify the northernmost, easternmost airports in the United States and the New York area airport with the windiest weather on February 12th, 2013.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Northernmost Airport:** The initial analysis identified Dillant Hopkins Airport as the northernmost airport, but this was found to be incorrect. After validating and correcting the data, Wiley Post Will Rogers Mem emerged as the northernmost airport with a latitude of 71.285446.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Easternmost Airport:** The initial analysis had inaccuracies due to positive longitude values. After corrections, Eareckson As emerged as the easternmost, considering U.S. territories, with a longitude of 174.06567797595457. However, within the contiguous United States, Eastport Municipal Airport is the easternmost.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Windiest Weather on February 12th, 2013:** The initial analysis revealed an outlier with an extremely high wind speed at EWR. After careful consideration, this value was deemed incorrect, and LGA was identified as having the windiest weather with a wind speed of 23.01560.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis underscores the critical importance of data validation and the handling of outliers in deriving accurate insights from any data-driven analysis. The corrected data provided more plausible results, aligned with external validations, leading to more reliable conclusions.\n",
